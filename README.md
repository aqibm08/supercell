# CIF Supercell Generator

This Python script allows you to create supercells from CIF (Crystallographic Information File) data. Supercells are expanded representations of the original crystal structure, which can be useful for simulations and other purposes.

## Introduction

CIF Supercell Generator is a Python script that reads CIF files, extracts information about the crystal structure, and generates supercells with expanded dimensions. It's particularly useful for materials science and computational chemistry researchers who need larger crystal structures for simulations.

## Features

- Parses CIF files and extracts crystallographic data.
- Creates supercells with adjustable dimensions.
- Generates new CIF files for the supercells.
